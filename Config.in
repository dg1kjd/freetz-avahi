		Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on
		a local network. This means that you can plug your laptop
		or computer into a network and instantly be able to view other
		people who you can chat with, find printers to print to or find
		files being shared. This kind of technology is already found in
		Apple MacOS X (branded Rendezvous, Bonjour  and sometimes Zeroconf)
		and is very convenient. Avahi is mainly based on Lennart Poettering's
		flexmdns mDNS implementation for Linux which has been discontinued
		in favour of Avahi.
